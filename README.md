 Video game involving fantasy creatures:


- Creature types are (Zombie, Troll and Wizard).
- Core attributes are categorized as strength, intellect, armor and speed which can hold any value between 1 and 10. Of course, each generated creature can have different values for attributes.
- Attributes can also change any time for any creature.
- Available actions which could be applied are death, revival, or equipping weapons. For the sake of simplicity, please start with only “has a weapon”. Later, this shall be refactored if time permits.
- The game should have a functionality through which no more actions or changes are allowed if the creature is dead. If the creature is revived, all previous values should be restored.
- Leadership is an additional attribute that should be present to apply for each creature. A value of leadership can range between -100 and 100 and should be generated based on the values of the four core attributes. Please keep in mind that leadership can only have a positive value once three or more of the core attributes have reached at least 5 as a value. Feel free to elaborate your own creativity to figure out how to generate the leadership value.


 H2 database is configured.
 
- Weapons are classified as sword, hammer and wand.

Restful design used in the game,
